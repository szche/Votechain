# Votechain
Blockchain-based voting system made as a project for Cryptography class.

### How it works
Before the voting process starts, the main committee (or any other govt body) creates the genesis block, specyfing which public key is allowed to cast a vote, selecting block producers and parties.

Blocks are produced in a "round-robin" fashion by the block producers. The pprocess is not fully decentralized and trustless (but traditional elections are not too).

### TODO
 - Enhance privacy
 - Add GUI
