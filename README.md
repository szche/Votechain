Blockchain-based voting system made as a project for Cryptography class.

### How it works
Before the voting process starts, the main Committee (or any other government body responsible for organizing elections) create "bootstrapping kit" This kit consists of:
- Public keys of voting committees responsible for overseeing voting process
- Public keys of parties taking part in the election process

Voting committiees act as trustworthy nodes that handle votes and are reponsible for validating transactions and including them in the blocks. The process is not fully trustless and decentralized (but traditional elections are not too).

### TODO
 - Add networking
 - Enhance privacy
 - Add GUI
